title: zig-a-zig-ah! (CC2652 Stick)

*Last updated: 08/03/2020, info about first prototype and initial testing*

# Overview

![zig-a-zig-ah! preview](/_assets/zzh-first-prototype.jpg)

 zig-a-zig-ah! (zzh, for short) is little USB-stick form factor dev board for multiprotocol RF tinkering.

 It features:

 - TI [CC2652R](http://www.ti.com/product/CC2652R) or [CC2652RB](http://www.ti.com/product/CC2652RB) ([discussion](https://github.com/electrolama/zig-a-zig-ah/issues/1)) SimpleLinkâ„¢ multi-standard wireless MCU, a multiprotocol 2.4 GHz wireless microcontroller targeting Thread, ZigbeeÂ®, BluetoothÂ® 5 Low Energy, IEEE 802.15.4g, IPv6-enabled smart objects (6LoWPAN) and proprietary systems.
 - Communicates with the host computer via the common CH340 USB-UART bridge, no manual driver installation needed in most cases (Windows and Linux).
 - Self-programming via the TI [CC-series serial bootstrap loader](https://github.com/JelmerT/cc2538-bsl) (as long as it is not disabled in code!), pushbutton on the default BSL pin to put the device into this mode.
 - SWD debug header, in case you disable BSL by accident or want a proper debug interface. Sadly this is not a standard header due to space constraints, see below for the details of a small "debug adapter" board.
 - SMA antenna port for an external antenna of your choice. Go wild or pick something discrete.

Think of it as an upgrade to the ubiquitous [CC2531 USB Sticks](https://www.google.com/search?q=cc2531+stick) commonly used for Zigbee tinkering. CC2652 has a much beefier processor, more memory and a sane free compiler that should enable easier development compared to the old 8051 based CC2530/1 based devices.

## Current status

First prototype unit built and passed all preliminary tests!

One of the nice things about these new chips from TI is the inclusion of a serial bootloader in the ROM. Enabled by default at the factory and available unless modified by the application otherwise, this means that you can burn code without needing an external programmer:

Obligatory blinkenlights:

Debug adapter to get access to the SWD programming interface. Also can be used to perform RF tests using TI software:

Finally, a quick test of zigbee2mqtt:

A little more work is needed before I am happy releasing this but it is close!

Revision A, Draft 3 design files [in the repository](https://github.com/electrolama/zig-a-zig-ah), some minor changes expected before the first proper release. Follow the development progress [on this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/OmerK/status/1212864418155028480).

Also thinking of a second variant that uses [CC2652P](http://www.ti.com/product/CC2652P), sadly not pin compatible with CC2652R (or CC2652RB) so this will have be a new board spin. "P" part has a built-in PA (but no LNA) and should provide better range.

# ACKs

Name credit goes to [@9600](https://twitter.com/9600/), this had a much boring name before he suggested zig-a-zig-ah!
