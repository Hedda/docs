title: zig-a-zig-ah! (CC2652R Stick)

*Last updated: 08/03/2020, info about first prototype and initial testing*

# Overview

![zig-a-zig-ah! preview](/_assets/zzh-first-prototype.jpg)

 zig-a-zig-ah! (zzh, for short) is little USB-stick form factor dev board for multiprotocol RF tinkering.

 It features:

 - TI [CC2652R](http://www.ti.com/product/CC2652R) SimpleLinkâ„¢ multi-standard wireless MCU, a multiprotocol 2.4 GHz wireless microcontroller targeting Thread, ZigbeeÂ®, BluetoothÂ® 5 Low Energy, IEEE 802.15.4g, IPv6-enabled smart objects (6LoWPAN) and proprietary systems.
 - [CC2652P](http://www.ti.com/product/CC2652P) also an option, has built-in PA (but no LNA?).
 - Communicates with the host computer via CP2102N/CP2104 USB-UART bridge.
 - Self-programming via the TI [CC-series serial bootstrap loader](https://github.com/JelmerT/cc2538-bsl) (as long as it is not disabled in code!), pushbutton on the default BSL pin to put the device into bootloader mode.
 - Cortex-M Debug Connector for SWD, in case you disable BSL by accident.
 - SMA antenna port for an external antenna of your choice. Secondary uFL port for measurements or an alternative antenna.

Think of it as an upgrade to the ubiquitous [CC2531 USB Sticks](https://www.google.com/search?q=cc2531+stick) commonly used for Zigbee tinkering. CC2652R has a much beefier processor, more memory and a sane free compiler option that should enable easier development compared to the old CC2531 based option.

First prototype unit built and passed all preliminary tests!

One of the nice things about these new chips from TI is the inclusion of a serial bootloader in the ROM. Enabled by default at the factory and available unless modified by the application otherwise, this means that you can burn code without needing an external programmer:

Obligatory blinkenlights:

Debug adapter to get access to the SWD programming interface. Also can be used to perform RF tests using TI software:

Finally, a quick test of zigbee2mqtt:

A little more work is needed before I am happy releasing this but it is close!

Revision A, Draft 3 design files [in the repository](https://github.com/electrolama/zig-a-zig-ah), some minor changes expected before the first proper release. Follow the development progress [on this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/OmerK/status/1212864418155028480).

# ACKs

Name credit goes to [@9600](https://twitter.com/9600/), this had a much boring name before he suggested zig-a-zig-ah!

Special thanks to [@GeorgeIoak](https://twitter.com/GeorgeIoak) and [@matthewvenn](https://twitter.com/matthewvenn) for design review and comments.
